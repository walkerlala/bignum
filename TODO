- Add benchmark section: whether or not the calculation at small precision is as fast as primitive type

- enable support for c++17.
  e.g., std::is_constant_evaluated() is added >= c++20

- provide Decimal::MaxValue and Decimal::MinValue

- constexpr constructor for float/double.
- make gmp function constexpr, so that all construction and calculation interfaces are truely constexpr

- wrap gmp function and create one around GmpWrapper

- make div increase scale configurable by compile settings

- support conversion from boost::int256_t if boost is detected
  Remember to change the definitions of LargeIntegralType

- nodiscard option for ErrCode

- make constexpr failure string more specified and readable
  for example, operator+=()'s overflow string could contains the exact number.
  This would require making `to_string()` constexpr.

- readme, add the following sections
## assert or abort

## div increase scale

## SYNOPSIS of class Decimal
