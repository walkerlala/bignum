- Add benchmark section: whether or not the calculation at small precision is as fast as primitive type

- constexpr constructor for float/double.
- make literal float initialization constexpr

- make gmp function constexpr, so that all construction and calculation interfaces are truely constexpr
  so that we could define kMinDecimal and kMaxDecimal

- enable support for c++17.
  e.g., std::is_constant_evaluated() is added >= c++20

- wrap gmp function and create one around GmpWrapper

- make div increase scale configurable by compile settings

- support conversion from boost::int256_t if boost is detected
  Remember to change the definitions of LargeIntegralType and those "sizeof(T) vs 16"

- propogate compiler option to subpackage
